SQLI-eChallenge-Train-DotNET
The aim of this exercise is to design and write a code to pass all tests.
 A train is made of different types of wagons: head, passenger, restaurant, and cargo.
 Each type has its specific representation:
 - Head :      <HHHH if its the last wagon
 HHHH> if it is the first wagon
 - Passenger  : |OOOO|
 - Restaurant : |hThT|
 - A cargo wagon can be either empty or loaded
 - If empty : its represented as |____|
 - If loaded: its represented as |^^^^|
 The wagons are connected by "::"
